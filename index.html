          A 2020 black comedy-drama film directed by Thomas Vinterberg. Teachers
          Martin, Tommy, Peter, and Nikolaj astruggle with unmotivated students
          and feel that their lives have become boring and stale. At a dinner
          celebrating Nikolaj's 40th birthday, the group begins to discuss the
          theory of psychiatrist Finn Skårderud — that humans are born with a
          blood alcohol content (BAC) deficiency of 0.05%, and that being at
          0.05% makes one more creative and relaxed. The friends decide to
          embark on an experiment to test Skårderud's theory.

          The tale of how a great vision and an epic failure changed the lives
          of billions. The ideas that dominate the tech industry and our day to
          day lives were born at a secretive Silicon Valley start-up named
          'General Magic', which spun out of Apple in 1990 to create the first
          handheld personal communicator (or "smartphone").
